File "copy.c" was downloaded from moodle and compiled in the following manner:
gcc copy.c -DBUF_SIZE=20 -DSYNC -o copy
Files for testing were created with the use of this command:
truncate -s SIZE FILE

default buffer size, file 30MB
real    0m0,090s
user    0m0,021s
sys     0m0,070s


default buffer size, file 100KB
real    0m0,009s
user    0m0,000s
sys     0m0,009s

buffer size 20000, file 30MB
real    0m0,049s
user    0m0,004s
sys     0m0,032s

buffer size 20000, file 100KB
real    0m0,009s
user    0m0,005s
sys     0m0,004s

1. The bigger the file, the longer the time to copy it - this is obvious.
2. The bigger the buffer, the faster is copying - less iterations happen. If buffer is too big, though,
it may happen that it could decrease perfomance.
3. Syncronisation also decreases perfomance as operating system watis for copying to be completed, while without
this flag it may finish work earlier than it will be done.
