Output of the Program 1:
"Hello
Hello
"

Output of the Program 2:
"Hello


"

Explanation:
My system has line buffered stdout.
In Program 1, when we call printf("Hello"), buffer is filled in with "Hello".
Then when we call fork(), process is copied, and buffer is also copied,
so now we have two processes with "Hello" inside their buffers.
Then we call printf("\n"), and both buffers now have "Hello\n".
Then both processes flush their buffers because of "\n"
(indicator of the new line, and stdout is line buffered).
So, we get output: "Hello\nHello\n".

In Program 2, when we call printf("Hello\n"), string is printed, and then buffer flushes.
Now buffer is empty, and after fork() both processes have empty buffer.
Then both buffers are filled in with "\n" (after printf("\n")), and they are flushing
because "\n" is an indicator of the new line and stdout is line buffered.
So, we have the following output: "Hello\n\n\n".
